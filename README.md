## Purpose 
The US Census Bureau has been distributing household surveys for the COVID-19 pandemic and afterward to determine the impact on mental health. The National Center for Health Statistics congregated this survey data into a user-friendly data set accessible by the public. The purpose of this comprehensive analysis is to look at anxiety and depression indicators and the varying demographics to understand further the distribution of mental health in the United States. This dataset includes the value of reported symptoms during the last 7 days of anxiety or depression. 

## Dataset 
"The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment."
